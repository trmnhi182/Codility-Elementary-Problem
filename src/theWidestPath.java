/**
 * There are N trees (numbered from 0 to Nâˆ’1) in a forest. The K-th tree is located at coordinates (X[K], Y[K]).
 * We want to build the widest possible vertical path, such that there is no tree on it. The path must be built
 * somewhere between a leftmost and a rightmost tree, which means that the width of the path cannot be infinite.
 * What is the width of the widest possible path that can be built? Write a function that, given two arrays X and Y
 * consisting of N integers each, denoting the positions of trees, returns the width of the widest possible path that
 * can be built.
 * <p>
 * 1. Given X=[1, 8, 7, 3, 4, 1, 8], Y=[6, 4, 1, 8, 5, 1, 7], the function should return 3.
 * 2. Given X=[5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7], Y=[3, 4, 5, 1, 3, 7], the function should return 2.
 * 3. Given X=[6, 10, 1, 4, 3], Y=[2, 5, 3, 1, 6], the function should return 4.
 * 4. Given X=[4, 1, 5, 4], Y=[4, 5, 1, 3], the function should return 3.
