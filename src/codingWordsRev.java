/**You are given a non-empty string S consisting of N characters. In this problem we consider only strings that
 * consist of lower-case English letters (aâˆ’z) and spaces. S can be divided into words by splitting it at the spaces
 * and removing them. We want to reverse every word in S.
 *
 * For example, given S = "we test coders", there are three words: "we", "test" and "coders". Reversing the words gives
 * "ew", "tset" and "sredoc".
 * The goal is to return a string with every word in string S reversed and separated by spaces, so the result in the above
 * example should be "ew tset sredoc". You can assume that if there are K spaces in S then there are exactly K + 1 words.
 * Write a function that, given a non-empty string S consisting of N characters, returns the reversal of every word of S.
 * For example, given S = "we test coders", the function should return "ew tset sredoc", as explained above.
